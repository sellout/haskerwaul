cabal-version: 3.0

name: haskerwaul-trample
version: 0.1.0.0
synopsis: ???
description: This is like `haskerwaul-base`, except that it uses all the same
             module names as actual `base`. So, all you need to do is switch the
             dependency in your build file, and now you're using Haskerwaul. The
             problem is if/when Haskerwaul's replacements don't match up 100%.
             In that case, you can either do package-qualified imports using
             this dependency /and/ base, or depend on haskerwaul-base /and/ base
             and have non-conflicting module names.
